# Resting

http://dnd-5e.herokuapp.com/optionalrule/rest-variants

## Gritty Realism

This is a Rest variant that is present in the DMG. If this was made for any type of setting, it would be this. The grueling pace that comes with this resting system, I feel, really brings the grim and dire circumstances of this setting to life. Also, it gives me the impression of quests and journeys taking several in-game days, which brings the sheer size of Eredane into light. This system does not work too well for dungeon crawls, but Midnight does not seem to be too "dungeon crawly" to me (except for Theros Obsidia, but that's one hell of a dungeon lol). The only thing I would change is to restore all hit dice after a long rest (except for orcs, who get 1 fewer because of Troubled Dreams). I would also rule that a long rest will heal all levels of exhaustion.

# Magic

I personally think that magic is probably fine with the resting mechanic above. It will definitely make spell casters think before burning through their spell slots. Who knows when their next long rest will be? Still, more can probably be done to make magic really seem like the precious resource the setting claims it is.

## Spell Energy

No more spell slots! Full casters gain 1 spell point every level, half casters get 1 spell point every 2 levels, and quarter casters get 1 spell point every 3 levels. Whenever a spell is cast that is first level or higher, you spend spell energy equal to the spell level. As a bonus action, you may gain spell energy equal to your proficiency bonus. Doing so incurs one level of exhaustion. Whenever you recover spell slots (like arcane recovery), you recover spell energy instead. You regain all spell energy after a long rest. Spell talismans will work like they did in the older books.

Unfortunately, this poses a problem for sorcerers and their sorcery points. This is roughly the same thing, and I would imagine this being VERY confusing to keep track of both pools. And spell energy also appears to be tough to implement in virtual tabletop games like Roll20 and DnDBeyond.

## Spell Slot Cost

So if we are going to stick with spell slots, what if all spells cost two spell slots? If you were at a point where you only had one slot, you could cast the spell, but you would incur 1 level of exhaustion. Alternatively, you can incur 1 level of exhaustion as a bonus action and restore spell slots equal to your proficiency bonus (e.g., a proficiency bonus of +5 will grant 1 5th level spell slot, 5 1st level spell slots, or a mixture of slots in between). Spell talismans will revert a spell or spell school to only costing one spell slot.

## Astirax Detection

If you don't want to mess with any of the mechanics, maybe something a little more thematic? In addition to Astirax being able to detect magic items and full casters at all times within 600 feet, they can detect any 1st level spell cast in a 600-foot radius (including spells cast by Paladins and Rangers). For every level beyond the 1st, the range increases by another 600 feet, to a maximum radius of 5400 feet when a 9th-level spell is cast.

# Crafting

## Common Items

I believe that there was no mention of charm crafting in LoD due to crafting in 5E being utterly terrible and nigh useless. And given the lack of economy and basically everything in Midnight, I believe that crafting would be more useful in this system than most, giving the players the ability to create their own goods that they need to survive. So I found this crafting system, and I believe that it works pretty well. It ties in well with the Gritty Realism rest variant mentioned above (although since a long rest would be seven days, you would roll the CP d20 seven times, giving the player a high chance to create at least one item per long rest given that the player has enough raw materials). It also makes tool proficiency in 5E actually useful. I also like the CP system as it makes it simple for PCs and NPCs to pool their efforts to craft something faster. I would actually homebrew adding the player's INT modifier to these rolls as well, giving a reason to have everyone but Wizards not dump INT. This obviously adds some extra bookkeeping, but I don't think that it's that bad given that you would forage once per day and crafting only happens on a long rest.

## Charms and Herbal Concoctions

Charms and herbal concoctions are single-use pseudo-magic items that grant a temporary bonus or can be imbued with a spell that will be cast once activated. (They are covered in much better detail in the 3.5 book.) These items do not radiate magic and are not detected by Astirax. Only one charm or herbal concoction can be active on a creature at a time. Charms are crafted with any trinket or object. You must be a spellcaster to craft charms. If you are proficient in arcana, add your proficiency to their CP roll, otherwise halve the result. On the other hand, infused oils, gnaw roots, and salves can be crafted from herbs and other ingredients. For you to do that, you must have tool proficiency with either Alchemist Supplies or an Herbalist Kit. The CP rating will instead depend on your nature proficiency rather than your arcana proficiency. Charms and herbal concoctions have 4 levels of potency: Minor, Lesser, Greater, and True. To create Greater and True charms or herbal concoctions, you must be at least at the appropriate level. The material components must meet or exceed the GP value below to craft the charm or concoction.

## Spell Talismans

If you want to experiment with spell talismans, lesser spell talismans are made in the same way as charms and are undetectable by Astirax. Greater talismans will follow the rules for making permanent magic items and will require the party to be in the vicinity of a powerful nexus.

# Other Rules

There are other rules that I think would make sense in this setting, but I don't really have much to add to them. Most of them just add more bookkeeping and tedious inventory management (which I like :) ) so your mileage may vary. I am speaking of ammunition, wilderness survival, encumbrance, and weapon/armor durability. However, there are a few other homebrew rules that I found or made up that I wanted to touch on.

## Death

I am personally not a fan of killing characters (those 5E character sheets take a long time to make), but I also think that combat should be punishing and that dropping to zero HP should pose at least some consequences. There is a random injury table in the DMG, but I think that's kinda clunky and a little too crazy, especially given how hard a restoration spell is to come by. So I think a good middle ground would be for players to get one level of exhaustion whenever their HP reaches 0.

## Healer's Kit Dependency

http://dnd-5e.herokuapp.com/optionalrule/healing

I obviously really like the Tools and Kits in 5e, and it's frankly a crime how underutilized they are. I think this rule makes things a little more realistic. I also really like the Preserver Heroic Path so this makes that path more useful :)

## Exhaustion

So I have been talking about exhaustion a lot. I have been following the One DnD Unearthed Arcana things that have been coming out recently. And while a lot of the content is pretty hit and miss, they did overhaul the exhaustion mechanic, and I think that they knocked it out of the park with this one. It reads as follows:

> EXHAUSTED[CONDITION]

> While you are subjected to the Exhausted Condition (known in older books as Exhaustion), you experience the following effects:

> Levels of Exhaustion. This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 10.

> d20 Rolls Affected. When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.

> Spell Save DCs Affected. Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.

> Ending the Condition. Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer Exhausted.

Remember that if you use the gritty realism resting mechanic I mentioned above, you will heal all levels of exhaustion, rather than just one, on a long rest.

I love this! It's debilitating and really stinks if you accumulate a lot of them. But it's dead simple and adds a layer of tangible wear and tear on your character as they embark on adventures in this harsh and unforgiving world.

## Feats

This is a tough one. I am torn as to whether Heroic Paths should just be ruled as being given out without requiring a feat. I don't think that the Heroic Paths requiring a feat slot is that bad of a call (in my opinion, 5e characters just seem more powerful compared to 3.5 characters, so requiring Heroic Paths taken as feats might be Edge Studio's method to balance them out; I could be very wrong though). But regardless, LoD also includes additional feats. They aren't bad and fit the flavor of the setting pretty well. But, since Heroic Paths will largely be taking up your feat slots, no one will ever take these. Maybe add an extra feat at first level as part of the background or something?
