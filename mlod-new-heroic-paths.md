# Giantblooded

A rare hero in the world of Aryth is known as giantblooded, though it is disputed whether or not the blood of giants truly flows through his veins. This hero grows to eight feet tall or more and is truly terrifying in battle. Though large in size, the giantblooded hero tends to have a subdued personality and often finds it more beneficial to blend in as best he can rather than draw the attention of those who would see all heroes destroyed.

# Seer

Seers are gifted with second sight, an ancient and mysterious gift. Unfortunately, these messages that manifest seemingly at random are often vague and fragmented which often drive these gifted individuals to madness. Some strong willed seers persevere however, and are able to piece together their fragmented visions into some crucial intel and are eventually able to tug at the fates themselves to give them a most needed edge against the shadow.

Seers are often introspective, searching always within themselves for the answers they cannot glean from their visions.

### **Nudge of the universe**

- You acquire vision points equal to your character proficiency bonus. These points replenish after a long rest.
- You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know.
- At the DM's discretion, they may spend 1 vision point and cast 1 divination spell through you (though not when doing so would endanger you, such as during combat) in order to convey useful story information to the party. The spell level must be equal to or less than 1/2 the character level.

---

### **Seer Sight (Past)**

(SEER heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 4 and the Nudge of the Universe heroic path feat._

Your second sight is beginning to form more concrete stories, granting you insight into events past. You gain the following benefits:

- Your intelligence or wisdom increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As an action, you may spend 1 vision point and you can now divine information from an object, place, or person that you are touching. You can see all events that occurred to or near the target. Using this ability requires uninterrupted concentration, during which the information is transferred to you as a series of quick flashes in your mind. You may choose to look back several days, several months, or several years. If looking back over days, you gain a detailed understanding of all of the day's events. If looking back over months, you gain a comprehensive understanding of events of each week, with dramatic events being highlighted. If looking back over years, you gain a general understanding of events of each season, with dramatic events being highlighted. Each day, month, or hour observed requires 1 minute of concentration.

### **Dance of Fate**

---

### **Seer Sight (Present)**

(SEER heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 12 and the Dance of Fate heroic path feat._

Mastering your second sight, you now have greater agency as to what your visions reveal. You gain the following benefits:

- Your intelligence or wisdom increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As an action, you may spend 1 vision point and concentrate on any subject (person, place or thing) and ask a question on said subject. From there, the DM will select the appropriate Divination spell to cast to bring you as close as possible to your answer. The spell level must be equal to or less than 1/2 the character level.
- _Note: Because your powers do not actually rely on communication with a divine entity, all of your results convey information using sight, sound, smell, and other sensory information, rather than actual words. For instance, augury would provide a positive or negative feeling, rather than the words "weal" or "woe". Likewise, when using speak with dead, you can experience what the body saw, felt, heard, etc. about specific events or topics, but cannot ask it actual questions._

### **Seer Sight (Future)**

# Spellsoul

There are many in the lands of Aryth who are born with the spark of magic within them, but for some reason or another never learn to use it beyond a minor enchantment or useful trick. Still, the arcane energies that flow within them yearn to find an outlet, and the spellsoul often finds himself in the company of a more powerful caster at some point in his life. When magic is used around a spellsoul, he can feel it almost as if he had shaped the magic himself. He is able to lend his energy to power the spells of others, and to use the energy within him to shape and change any magic that is cast in his presence.

---

### **Untapped Potential**

(SPELLSOUL heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Have not selected feats from a different heroic path. Cannot be a class that can (or will be able to) perform spell casting of first level spells or higher._

You have a number of raw energy points equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest + your proficiency bonus. If a spell is being cast within 30 ft. of you, as a reaction, you may spend raw energy equal to the spell level cast. If done, the original spell caster retains their spell slot. You must have enough raw energy points to cover the spell cost. Raw energy is recovered after a long rest.

---

### **Metamagic Aura (Lesser)**

(SPELLSOUL heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 4 and the Untapped Potential heroic path feat._

You are able to use your awareness of magic to shift and shape spells cast in the area around you. This ability manifests itself in various forms of metamagic that you can use to alter spells as they are cast. Some of the abilities can be used to enhance the spells cast by your allies, while others can be used to weaken or even nullify spells cast by your enemies. Any time a spell is cast within 30 ft. of you, you can choose, as a reaction, to use any metamagic ability you have access to in this heroic path to modify the spell. You can target any spell whose level is equal to or less than half your character level (rounded down). You must know that a spell is being cast to use this ability. Thus, you could not affect a silent spell being cast by an invisible opponent. Quickened spells and other spell-like abilities cannot be modified by this ability. You do not need to know which spell is being cast in order to affect it, although it is helpful. You may identify the spell by making a successful intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 15 + spell level). If unsuccessful, you may still attempt to modify the spell, but the effects applied may be helpful, superfluous, or dangerous, depending on the actual spell. Knowing what spell is being cast is a tactical factor, but in no way affects your ability; for instance, allied casters might explain a round ahead of time that they are going to cast a fireball, and that they want you to empower it. If the casters change their mind and casts a lightning bolt instead, your ability would still empower it. The following abilities can be applied to a spell via your metamagic aura:

- Enlarge Spell - When damage is rolled for a spell, you can spend 1 raw energy point to have the caster re-roll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). The caster must use the new rolls.
- Extend Spell - When a spell is cast that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 raw energy point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
- Reduce Spell - You can spend 1 raw energy point to reduce a spell. All variable, numeric effects of a reduced spell are decreased by 1 die. Spell range is reduced by half. If spell affects an area, reduce the affected area by 5 ft (e.g. Fireball will only affect a 15 ft radius). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as that made to overcome spell resistance) are not affected. Spells without random variables are not affected.

### **Spell Attraction**

(SPELLSOUL heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 8 and the Metamagic Aura (Lesser) heroic path feat._

Your metamagic aura has strengthened and offers greater protection at
the cost of hungering for more magic. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.
- Your metamagic aura gains the following benefit:
  - Attract Spell - When a spell is cast within 30 ft of you, you can use 2 raw energy points to become the target of the spell. In order for this ability to work, the spell must have a target (although the target can be an area, such as a fireball) other than the spell caster. Area of effect spells still affect others, but are centered on you.

---

### **Metamagic Aura (Greater)**

(SPELLSOUL heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 12 and the Spell Attraction heroic path feat._

Your metamagic aura is now strong enough to empower spells to truly terrifying heights. Your metamagic aura gains the following benefits:

- Heighten Spell - When a spell is cast within 30 ft. of you that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 raw energy points to give 1 target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
- Twinned Spell - When a spell is cast within 30 ft. of you that targets only 1 creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of raw energy points equal to the spell's level (minimum of 1) to target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than 1 creature at the spell's current level.

---

### **Spell Deflection**

(SPELLSOUL heroic path feat)

_Prerequisite: Minimum level of 16 and the Metamagic Aura (Greater) heroic path feat._

You have mastered your metamagic aura and you now have the ability to bend spells to your whims. Your metamagic aura gains the following benefit:

- Redirect Spell - When a spell is cast within 30 ft. of you, you can use 5 raw energy points to redirect the spell to another target. In order for this ability to work, the spell must have a target (although the target can be an area, such as a fireball) other than the spell caster.
